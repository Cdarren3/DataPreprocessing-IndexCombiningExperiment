# Data Preprocessing for Index Combining Experiment


## Objectives

* Explore the feasibility of combining existing Hong Kong social-economic indexes with data available online for study purposes
* Assuming every index share equal weight in the combined index
* Using combination formula as an approach to do a randomized selection of indexes for dimensionality reduction of the combined index
    * Using 10C5 as a test(i.e. randomly choosing 5 out of 10 available indexes as the component of the combined index)
* Listing out the results of the index generated by different combinations


## Tools Involved

* Pandas
* Numpy
